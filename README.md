# Hello-world
some type of a repository

Hello, My name is Samat. I was born in 2003 in the Kazan. It is city of the Russian Federation. I am learning c#. I enjoy it. Peharps, in the future i will creat own company of video games.
Also i want to know English language very well like a native speaker. But it difficult for me, because my lazyness doesn't let me do it. Comrades, it's really hard to learn ten new foreign words in a day. After learning i feel myself upset.
Also i like play video games. I have Nintendo switch and The legenf of Zelda BOTW is the best game, that i have plaed ever.
